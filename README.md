VRA Ψ-Frame  (Visual Essence Adaptive Frame) is an  hybrid representations of video frames. It combines a traditional Base Visual Layer (BVL) with a lightweight VRAW Essence Layer (VEL) containing abstract frame parameters. An Adaptive Controller then uses this VEL to interpret frame characteristics or drive adaptive behaviors.
# VRA Ψ-Frame: An Experimental Hybrid Video Essence System

VRA Ψ-Frame (Visual Essence Adaptive Frame) is an experimental Python-based system for exploring hybrid representations of video frames. It combines a traditional Base Visual Layer (BVL) with a lightweight VRAW Essence Layer (VEL) containing abstract frame parameters. An Adaptive Controller then uses this VEL to interpret frame characteristics or drive adaptive behaviors.

This project is based on an initial concept and aims to provide a modular framework for experimenting with such hybrid approaches.

## Core Components

* **`VRAWEncoder`**: Extracts the VRAW Essence Layer (VEL) from frames. This includes parameters like:
    * `scale_factor` (brightness proxy)
    * `offset` (contrast proxy)
    * `fractal_signature` (sum of pixels modulo 256)
    * `edge_density` (measure of detected edges)
* **`CHIDS` (Cubic Holographic Indexed Data Storage)**: Stores sequences of VELs, allowing for analysis of temporal dynamics of the frame "essence".
* **`AdaptiveController`**: Interprets VEL data to generate insights, classifications, or control signals. Its behavior can be tuned with `alpha`, `beta`, `gamma` parameters.
* **`AdaptiveAES`**: Provides AES-256 encryption for securing VEL data or other sensitive information, using a key derived from a chaotic logistic map.
* **`HybridFrameProcessor`**: Orchestrates the processing pipeline, generating the BVL (e.g., as JPEG), the VEL, encrypting the VEL, and invoking the Adaptive Controller.
* **`utils`**: Helper functions, e.g., for JPEG compression/decompression.

## Features

* Hybrid representation of video frames (BVL + VEL).
* Lightweight feature extraction for the VRAW Essence Layer.
* Temporal analysis of VEL using CHIDS.
* Adaptive interpretation of frame essence.
* Chaotic key-based AES encryption for VEL.
* Modular design for experimentation and extension.

    git clone <your-repository-url-here>
    cd vraw_psyframe_hybrid
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    # venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:

## Usage

The main demonstration script is located in the `examples` directory. To run it:

```bash
python examples/demo_hybrid.py
This script will:

Process a single sample frame, showcasing its Base Visual Layer (BVL), VRAW Essence Layer (VEL), encrypted VEL, and the output of the Adaptive Controller.
Process a sequence of sample frames, demonstrating how CHIDS can be used with VELs and how the Adaptive Controller can provide a temporal summary.
Display visualizations using Matplotlib where appropriate.
Experimental Nature
Important: This system is highly experimental. The features extracted by VRAWEncoder and the interpretations made by the AdaptiveController are illustrative examples designed to showcase the hybrid concept. The framework is intended as a starting point for research and development into more sophisticated adaptive video representations and processing techniques based on lightweight "essence" metadata.
